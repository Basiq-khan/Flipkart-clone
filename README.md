# 🛒 Flipkart Clone  

This is a **Flipkart-inspired e-commerce clone** that I designed and developed from scratch.  
It is fully responsive and built using **HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript**.  

The project replicates the look and feel of the Flipkart website, focusing on layout, design consistency, and interactivity.
